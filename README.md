## Collaborate

Want to add a config file you can't forget?  Fork the repository and create a pull request!  
All styles and languages of files are welcome!  Maybe I will learn a thing or two..

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acgriswold/std-config.git # clone the repository and make your changes
```

Create an issue if any of the configurations don't work with your setup!
