# .dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files for various programs, and they help those programs manage their functionality.

Most noteably, they are prefixed with a '.' which is where they get their name.


Developers use a common directory and naming convension when using .dotfiles that can be used consistently between machines. One such use case is to boot up and configure a standard setup between computers or when transitioning to a new computer.

## Common .dotfiles

- `.bash_profile/ .bashrc`: Bash shell scripts that load each time a terminal session starts/ configures the shell
- `.zshrc`: Configures and customizes the Zsh shell (default for MacOS)
- `.vimrc`: Configurations for the Vim command line code editor
- `.gitconfig`: Setup and information for Git (including default alias configuration)
