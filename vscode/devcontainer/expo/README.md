# Expo Devcontainer
Dev containers are a quick way to setup development environments within vscode.  This one in particular
is great for cross platform and native development by using [Expo](https://expo.dev/) as the primary development tool.

## Use

Combine this template with the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose file` from [the docker/expo example](https://github.com/acgriswold/std-config/tree/main/docker/expo).
